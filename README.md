# project_euler_problem_3

This was a really challenging problem. I am still getting used to thinking algorithmicly inorder to solve these math problems. Finding a way to break down a number into it's smaller factors was challenging and I did not know how to do that. Once again, I needed help and did some googling looking at stackoverflow comments. I am still learning how to solve these problems like a programmer so I do not feel too bad about getting help online. Still, It is a clever solution! I would be lying if I said I did not get help on this problem.
